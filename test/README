fake-api.coffee: starts a simulation of the official Campfire server,
                 responding to a minimal set of API endpoints + enough of a
                 static tree to do non-internal-Chrome HTML page tests

public/: static tree for above; mostly useless now

fake-client.coffee: node-campfire powered fake client, to validate fake-api
